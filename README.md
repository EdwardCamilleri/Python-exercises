2 python coding challenge exercises 
Project 1: You are tasked to create an application in Python 3.6 that can perform the following actions:

 Take input from the user as an amount in £.
 Check the amount is less than £30. (This check would be against a txt file that would contain the value 30)
 If the amount is more than £30, ask the user to enter a Pin Number (stored inside the program)
 Once the check is completed, the user should get a message about successful transaction on the amount entered.
 Extra challenge - Ask the user for a name, log every transaction in a separate log file and give the user the option to change their spend limit
 
 Project 4: You are tasked to create an application in Python 3.6 that can perform the following actions:

Take inputs from the user as length and width of the room in meters.
Calculate the area of the room in sq meters.
Check the area is not more than 4 sq meters. (this check would be against a txt file that would contain the value 4)
If the area is more than 4 sq meters, inform the user that this room size is not available.
Extra challenge - Ask the user for a name, log every room measurement in a separate log file and give the user an option to change the area limit
